Cmake build readme

0. run `make models` to generate ufl headers 
1. `mkdir build` (in source builds are not recomended) and cd into build
2. cmake ../
3. make pugi (for pugi utility)
4. make poisson (to test poisson build)

Mesh files and documentation are still TODO, this is the current state of the build system

Libraries can either be specified with libname_DIR (so VTK_DIR or DOLFIN_DIR) when running cmake if they are in non-standard locations. - ex 'VTK_DIR=/path/to/vtk cmake../'

Libraries installed from the fijee-dev ppa (ppa:akshmakov/fijee-dev-ppa) should be findable with no additional parameters.


FIJEE DOES NOT BUILD AGAINST CURRENT VERSION OF DOLFIN IN FIJEE-DEV PPA, OPENCL VERSION OF DOLFIN COURTESY OF YANN COBIGO MUST BE USED (debian/ppa package for this is to do, install all necessary dolfin dependencies from PPA and build localy, specify location with DOLFIN_DIR)
