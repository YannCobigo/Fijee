Cmake build readme

1. `mkdir build` (in source builds are not recomended) and cd into build
2. cmake ../
3. make 

Mesh files and documentation are still TODO, this is the current state of the build system

Libraries can either be specified with libname_DIR (so VTK_DIR or DOLFIN_DIR) when running cmake if they are in non-standard locations. - ex 'VTK_DIR=/path/to/vtk cmake../'

Libraries installed from the fijee-dev ppa (ppa:akshmakov/fijee-dev-ppa) should be findable with no additional parameters.
