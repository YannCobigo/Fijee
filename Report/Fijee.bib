abstract ={Knowledge of the electrical conductivity properties of excitable
 tissues is essential for relating the electromagnetic fields generated
 by the tissue to the underlying electrophysiological currents. Efforts
 to characterize these endogenous currents from measurements
 of the associated electromagnetic fields would significantly benefit
 from the ability to measure the electrical conductivity properties of
 the tissue noninvasively. Here, using an effective medium approach, we
 show how the electrical conductivity tensor of tissue can be
 quantitatively inferred from the water self-diffusion tensor as
 measured by diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging. The effective
 medium model indicates a strong linear relationship between the
 conductivity and diffusion tensor eigenvalues (respectively, σ and
 d) in agreement with theoretical bounds and experimental
 measurements presented here (σ/d ≈ 0.844 ±
 0.0545 S⋅s/mm3, r2 =
 0.945). The extension to other biological transport phenomena is also
 discussed.},

    abstract = {{The success of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is deeply rooted in the powerful concept that during their random, diffusion-driven displacements molecules probe tissue structure at a microscopic scale well beyond the usual image resolution. As diffusion is truly a three-dimensional process, molecular mobility in tissues may be anisotropic, as in brain white matter. With diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion anisotropy effects can be fully extracted, characterized, and exploited, providing even more exquisite details on tissue microstructure. The most advanced application is certainly that of fiber tracking in the brain, which, in combination with functional MRI, might open a window on the important issue of connectivity. DTI has also been used to demonstrate subtle abnormalities in a variety of diseases (including stroke, multiple sclerosis, dyslexia, and schizophrenia) and is currently becoming part of many routine clinical protocols. The aim of this article is to review the concepts behind DTI and to present potential applications. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2001;13:534–546. {\copyright} 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

                Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a promising method for characterizing microstructural changes or differences with neuropathology and treatment. The diffusion tensor may be used to characterize the magnitude, the degree of anisotropy, and the orientation of directional diffusion. This review addresses the biological mechanisms, acquisition, and analysis of DTI measurements. The relationships between DTI measures and white matter pathologic features (e.g., ischemia, myelination, axonal damage, inflammation, and edema) are summarized. Applications of DTI to tissue characterization in neurotherapeutic applications are reviewed. The interpretations of common DTI measures (mean diffusivity, MD; fractional anisotropy, FA; radial diffusivity, D(r); and axial diffusivity, D(a)) are discussed. In particular, FA is highly sensitive to microstructural changes, but not very specific to the type of changes (e.g., radial or axial). To maximize the specificity and better characterize the tissue microstructure, future studies should use multiple diffusion tensor measures (e.g., MD and FA, or D(a) and D(r)).

    abstract = {{When a mesh of simplicial elements (triangles or tetrahedra) is used to form a piecewise linear approximation of a function, the accuracy of the approximation depends on the sizes and shapes of the elements. In finite element methods, the conditioning of the stiffness matrices also depends on the sizes and shapes of the elements. This paper explains the mathematical connections between mesh geometry, interpolation errors, and stiffness matrix conditioning. These relationships are expressed by error bounds and element quality measures that determine the fitness of a triangle or tetrahedron for interpolation or for achieving low condition numbers. Unfortunately, the quality measures for these two purposes do not agree with each other; for instance, small angles are bad for matrix conditioning but not for interpolation. Several of the upper and lower bounds on interpolation errors and element stiffness matrix conditioning given here are tighter than those that have appeared in the literature before, so the quality measures are likely to be unusually precise indicators of element fitness.}},
